# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

## Pymaceuticals Instructions

Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this you are tasked with:





* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic] sites changes over time for each treatment.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Include 3 observations about the results of the study. Use the visualizations you generated from the study data as the basis for your observations.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

As final considerations:

* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* You must use the Matplotlib library.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
CHECK CHECK CHECK (redundant)

* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Your scatter plots must include [error bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar). This will allow the company to account for variability between mice. You may want to look into [`pandas.DataFrame.sem`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sem.html) for ideas on how to calculate this.
CHECK CHECK CHECK

* Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!
  * Your legends should not be overlaid on top of any data.
  CHECK CHECK CHECK
    
  * Your bar graph should indicate tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green.
  CHECK CHECK CHECK
  
  * It should also include a label with the percentage change for each bar. You may want to consult this [tutorial](http://composition.al/blog/2015/11/29/a-better-way-to-add-labels-to-bar-charts-with-matplotlib/) for relevant code snippets.

## Hints and Considerations

* Be warned: These are very challenging tasks. Be patient with yourself as you trudge through these problems. They will take time and there is no shame in fumbling along the way. Data visualization is equal parts exploration, equal parts resolution.

* You have been provided a starter notebook. Use the code comments as a **guideline** of steps you may wish to follow as you complete the assignment. You do not have to follow them step-for-step. Do not get bogged down in trying to interpret and accomplish each step.

* Don't get bogged down in small details. Always focus on the big picture. If you can't figure out how to get a label to show up correctly, come back to it. Focus on getting the core skeleton of your notebook complete. You can always re-visit old problems.

* Remember: There are many ways to skin a cat, and similarly there are many ways to approach a data problem. The key throughout, however, is to break up your task into micro tasks. Try answering questions like: "How does my Data Frame need to be structured for me to have the right X and Y axis?" "How do I build a basic scatter plot?" "How do I add a label to that scatter plot?" "Where would the labels for that scatter plot come from?". Again! Don't let the magnitude of a programming task scare you off. Ultimately, every programming problem boils down to a handful of smaller, bite-sized tasks.

* Get help when you need it! There is never any shame in asking. But as always, ask a _specific_ question. You'll never get a great answer to: "I'm lost." Good luck!
